            <p>The need for rainfall in Texas is being felt from the panhandle to the valley with more than 97% of the state under a drought, according to the latest numbers from the <a href="https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/data/png/20220719/20220719_tx_trd.png">U.S. Drought Monitor.</a></p>

            <p>With drought conditions worsening each week, and several days reaching triple digits, many Texans are fearing another devastating drought like the one we saw in 2011.</p>

            <p>In the 2011 drought, farmers and ranchers saw agricultural losses that reached a record $7.62 billion -- the costliest drought in history -- according to the <a href="https://agrilifetoday.tamu.edu/2012/03/21/updated-2011-texas-agricultural-drought-losses-total-7-62-billion/">Texas AgriLife Extension Service.</a></p>
            
            <p>So is 2022 on track to reach devastation equal to 11 years ago? Let's take a look at drought data from the U.S. Drought Monitor for the first seven months of each year to compare.</p>
            <img src= "https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/data/png/20220719/20220719_tx_text.png" width="100%" alt="a png showing the U.S. Drought Monitor's Texas drought map for week ending on July 19, 2022">

            <p>The U.S. Drought Monitor is a weekly map released on Thursdays that shows which areas of the country are currently in drought using four classifications of severity. D1 is the least intense level of drought while D4 the most intense. Drought is defined as a soil-moisture deficit significant enough to have social, environmental or economic effects.</p>
            
            <p>Looking at the the cumulative percentages from D1 category and worse, it shows that at the start of the year in 2022 there were much higher percentages of drought compared to in 2011. But starting in April 2011, the drought percentages remained in the upper 90s, while in 2022 it fluctuated during those months and never went above 90% until July.</p>

            <p>But where the most dangerous conditions are experienced in an area in the D4 category, where you see exceptional and widespread crop and/ or pasture losses, and shortages of water in reservoirs, streams, and wells creating water emergencies.</p>
            
            <p>So how awful has the year been in 2022 so far compared to the same time period in 2011? Well ... not nearly as bad.</p>
            
            <br>
            
            <iframe title="[ Exceptional drought in Texas in 2011 vs. 2022 ]" aria-label="Grouped Bars" id="datawrapper-chart-4VJw8" src="https://datawrapper.dwcdn.net/4VJw8/1/" scrolling="no" frameborder="0" style="width: 0; min-width: 100% !important; border: none;" height="530"></iframe><script type="text/javascript">!function(){"use strict";window.addEventListener("message",(function(e){if(void 0!==e.data["datawrapper-height"]){var t=document.querySelectorAll("iframe");for(var a in e.data["datawrapper-height"])for(var r=0;r<t.length;r++){if(t[r].contentWindow===e.source)t[r].style.height=e.data["datawrapper-height"][a]+"px"}}}))}();</script>
            
            <br>
            
            <p>Although 2022's worst drought conditions began a month earlier, they are nowhere near the high average percentages reached in 2011. As highlighted in the month of July, 2022's exceptional drought is an average 19.3%, while in 2011 it was an average 72.7%.</p>
            
            <p>For more perspective, on October 4, 2011, the worst week of that devastating year, 88% of Texas was experiencing exceptional drought conditions.</p>

            <p>So far 2022 does not appear to be as awful as 2011 based on the monthly averages, but it could be setting us up for something worse down the line if the dry conditions and triple-digit temperatures don't let up.</p>
