# Comparing Texas' current drought conditions to the 2011 drought
---	
### Goal
---	
This project analyzed the current Texas drought conditions, which are troubling many, and compared them to the worst drought Texas has experienced in recent memory, to see if we are heading down the same dangerous environment. To achieve this, I looked over the average monthly drought percentages over the same time period in the year 2011 and 2022.

### Findings
---	
Although there have been high drought percentages in Texas this year, the worst category of drought does not cover the same percentage area as it did in 2011 during this time. Texas isn't in the worst shape possible, but it is cause for concern as where we are now could lead to a dry and devastating future.

### Data Collection
---	
[My Jupyter Notebook](https://github.com/carolinaszv/texas-drought/blob/main/Texas%20drought%202011%20vs.%202022.ipynb) contains the code behind my data collection and analysis.

I used the [U.S. Drought Monitor] (https://droughtmonitor.unl.edu/) to collect the data for the first seven months of both 2011 and 2022.

For the final analysis of the  project, I built two dataframes to show the monthly cumulative drought averages in Texas for both years and then the monthly D4 (or worst drought conditions) averages for both years.

### Analysis
---	
At first, I thought analyzing the rate of growth would be a better way to show the data, as I am limited to the months we've experienced this year and the worst drought month of 2011 was in October. I hyphothesized that it would be a good trend indicator and could show the possible future based on percentage changes -- especially if they turned out to be comparable to the numbers seen in 2011.

Alas, after working through the numbers and then trying to create a data viz, I realized that was not the best path to show the data.

So then, I went back to analyze the average monthly percentages in cumulative drought, meaning any area that was experiencing any categorical drought from D1 to D4. And then I did the same for the average monthly percentages in just the D4, or worst drought category.

This approach turned out to be a much better comparison and visually more compelling and telling.

### Skills & Growth
---	
With this project, I learned new codes for different mathematical problems, and was able to create multiple dataframes necessary to build the visualizations I thought would help show the comparison.

### Further Developments
---	
To really get a deeper comparison, I think it would be crucial to look further back in to the months leading up to the 2011 drought, which I believe began in September 2010. A look at rainfall during the analyzed time periods is also important to get a holistic view of the problems.
I think rate of change may still be beneficial, but a different approach for showcasing that information is necessary.
